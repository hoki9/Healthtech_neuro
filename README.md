# Neural Networks for Health Technology Applications (TX00DV62)

Neural Networks for Health Technology Applications is a freely selectable course in Bachelor of Information Technology Degree Programme students at Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. This repository contains the efforts of student group 9.

Case 1 - Heart Disease Classification
-------------------------------------

In this exercise we create an ANN to classify UCI Heart Disease -dataset.

Case 2 - Pneumonia
------------------

In this exercise we create CNN models to classify pneumonia in chest x-ray images.

Case 3 - Drug Reviews
---------------------

In this exercise we build a model to predict numerical ratings from textual drug reviews written by patients. This is done using text processing and a 1D CNN.
